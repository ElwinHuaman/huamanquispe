# Help Save the Punu Quechua in Peru!
The [Punu Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puno_Quechua), spoken by over 40% of the population in Peru's Puno region, is in danger of being lost. It's mainly used in spoken communication, with no written resources or educational resources.

> We are working to change that!

Our project, [Qichwabase](https://qichwa.wikibase.cloud/): A Structured Knowledge Base for the Quechua Language, is building a database of Quechua words, their usage, and translations. But we need your help to take it further.

# Our Goal:

Record the voices of Quechua Collao speakers (including adults and elders) and make these recordings available on the Wikimedia Ecosystem. This will:

- Support the creation of educational resources in Quechua
- Empower educators, learners, researchers, Quechua community to revitalize their language
- Aid in the preservation of this vital language

# Supporter:
We are thrilled to announce that our project is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation! This aligns with their mission of promoting free access to knowledge around the world.

# What We Will Do:

1. Leverage the existing [Qichwabase](https://qichwa.wikibase.cloud/), a vast knowledge base of Quechua words and translations.
2. Partner with communities in [Nuñoa](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distrito_de_Nuñoa), Peru to record speakers with diverse backgrounds.
3. Utilize the user-friendly [LinguaLibre](https://lingualibre.org/) tool to capture high-quality audio.
4. Deposit the recordings on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/), ensuring global accessibility.

# :heart: How You Can Help:
