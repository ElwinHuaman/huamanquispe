# Birthday Fundraising
Since my birthday is in a few weeks (the 1st of July), I am planning an informal birthday fundraising to support upcoming projects, such as "Reading Wikipedia in the classroom" and "Empowering Quechua Women communities", if you want more details, do not hesitate to drop me a message. Last year, with your support, we were able to implement a monthly workshop for Quechua communities, and these workshops are coming to an end, with the last session taking place in July. We are so thankful.
