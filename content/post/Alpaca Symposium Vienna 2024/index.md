# The Symposium: Bridging Threads of Science and Culture
The 2024 has been declared as the [International Year of Camelids (IYC 2024)](https://www.iyrp.info/international-year-camelids-iyc-2024) by the United Nations. In this sense, the BOKU-University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (Vienna, Austria), the UNALM-Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (Lima, Peru), and the Peruvian Embassy (Vienna, Austria) have organized the **Symposium on Alpacas in Peru: Bridging Threads of Science and Culture**, on the 7th of March, 2024, 17.00-21.00 at the BOKU-University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Festsaal 3rd floor, Gregor-Mendel-Strasse 33, 1180 Vienna.

# Connecting alpacas to their roots: a quechua experience by Elwin Huaman
The presentation brought a relevant point of view from the quechua communities when talking about alpacas. The presentation connected the following topics:

* **Tracing alpacas**: Where are alpacas coming from
* **Where do they live**: Talking about quechua farms
* **Who breed them**: Meeting quechua people
* **Connecting with them**: Tradition and culture

At the end of the presentations, garments designed and knitted by my mother (Ninfa Quispe) were appreciated by the attendes, whose had the opportunity to feel connected to alpaca breeders of the Andes of Peru.

# ðŸ¦™ Calling all Alpaca enthusiasts! ðŸ¦™
The symposium featured a variety of informative sessions on alpaca breeding, care, and fiber arts. FAO has declared 2024 as the International Year of Camelids. The Year will highlight how camelids are key to the livelihoods of millions of households in hostile environments across over 90 countries, particularly Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Together with the Peruvian Embassy, the evening featured interesting scientific presentations on alpaca research, Peruvian cocktails and finger food, and an exhibition of Peruvian textiles! 

My presentation will verse on connecting alpacas to their roots, a missing view from the Quechua communities ðŸ¥¹

Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn from the experts and connect with other alpaca lovers!

> Apparently, the Large Language Models, Alpaca, Llama, and VicuÃ±a, are planning to attend the symposium this year, but they can't decide who will be giving the opening remarks. ðŸ¤£
