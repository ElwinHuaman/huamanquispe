# What is Quechua Experience?

Quechua Experiences are activities designed and led by inspiring Quechua families. They go beyond typical tourism by immersing guests in true Quechua family traditions. It’s an opportunity for anyone to learn about their culture, traditions, or expertise without barriers.
Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against climate change:
KIPU is a knowledge engine, chatbot, web search engine and App that stores, evaluates, curates, and represents sustainable destinations.

We would like to invite you to be part of our true traditions by staying with us and make a positive impact on the world. For centuries, our lifestyle has been based on breeding alpacas and llamas, as well as cultivating potatoes.
