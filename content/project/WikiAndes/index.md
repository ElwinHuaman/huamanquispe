For all generations, fundamentally young people and adults, the need to distinguish between disinformation and trustworthy content has become critical. Thus, we (WikiAndes team + [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)) are implementing a Media and Information Literacy program, called **Bringing Wiki Projects to the Andes**.

Why:
- Accessing, creating or sharing content opens up a wide range of possibilities for all, as well as new risks.
- For supporting the information verification and evaluation.
- For bringing Media and Information Literacy to life.

How:
- Supporting schools to fight misinformation—when students find misinformation, teachers will be prepared.
- Helping teachers and students achieve their learning 
objectives.
- Developing media and information literate citizens: Think critically, click wisely.

What:
- Supporting learning worldwide through free knowledge projects, e.g., Reading Wikipedia in the Classroom (RWiC).
- Reading Wikipedia in the Classroom (RWiC) is the Wikimedia Foundation’s flagship teacher training program.

<p>"It is now 30 years since I first heard my mother, [Ninfa](https://huamanquispe.com/author/ninfa-quispe/), use the word [literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy). She taught Quechua speakers in Peru to read and write in Spanish, and today they are bilingual and can claim their rights in both languages. Now, it is my turn, and I believe that we need media and information literacy and the time to act is now." (Elwin Huaman)</p>
