# What is Illariy Chaska?

Illariy Chaska is an association designed and led by our family: Huaman Quispe. We provide opportunities for anyone to learn about our quechua culture, traditions, or expertise without barriers. For centuries, our lifestyle has been based on breeding alpacas and llamas, as well as cultivating potatoes, today we want to show you how we live in the Alpaca Ecosystem.

We would like to invite you to be part of our true traditions by staying with us and make a positive impact on the world.
