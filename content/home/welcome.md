Huaman Quispe is a Quechua family that has developed a sustainable farm, which provides activities designed and led by our Quechua family. We go beyond typical tourism by immersing guests in true Quechua family traditions. It’s an opportunity for anyone to learn about our culture, traditions, or expertise without barriers.

Let’s make it happen!.

Instead of imposing what the Quechua communities should learn, we ask them what they would like to learn or improve. We then prepare workshops focused on the topics they want to address and invite experts in the field to travel to the communities and share their knowledge.
